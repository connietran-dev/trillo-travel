# Trillo Travel

## Your all-in-one travel booking site

This travel app was developed using Sass and Flexbox.

## The power of Flexbox

With this site, the power of Flexbox is used to easily create mobile-responsive designs simply by changing `flex-direction` to column to stack elements on smaller breakpoints.

Ordering flex items with `order` also makes it easy to customize the order of items on smaller breakpoints.
